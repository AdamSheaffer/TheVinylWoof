# TheVinylWoof
Vinyl Woof is a single page application where users offer up their old/unwanted vinyl records for other people to grab.
When a user's record gets grabbed by someone, they receive a certain amount of "Woofie", which serves as credits or
karma. They can redeem those Woofie to grab albums from other users.
